# PieChartApplet
Java2 week4

This was my third individual assignment for JAVA PROGRAMMING II.

Here were the requirements for the assignment:

Use a news article with statistics that are good candidates for a pie chart: 
for example, political candidate preferences; percentages of those for, against, or undecided about a ballot measure; and so forth.

Cite the source for your input statistics.
